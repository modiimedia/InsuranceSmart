answer = "**Medicare Advantage** is a program designed to save money for the federal government.  When you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan (MA), you actually disenroll from Medicare and MA plan you choose is then 100% responsible to provide all your medical care.  Most MA plans have a provider network and will not pay for services outside of network, or they may charge a higher price for services outside of network.  Some plans have broader choices, but in most cases you must have a Primary Care Provider to navigate you through provider services to include specialists and other services you are administered.  In most cases these referrals for work to be done must be approved prior to services being rendered. \n\nIn addition, most Medicare Advantage plans require co-payments for doctor visits, specialists, hospital stays, ER, etc. and all have a maximum annual dollar amount you must pay each year for out of pocket expenses in event you utilize alot of services in a year and this ranges from $2500 to $7500 in network, depending upon the plan you choose.  These charges go up when using providers Out of Network and in some cases No Services will be rendered Out of Network.\n\n**Traditional Medicare** is the original program established by the Social Security Administration for the medical care of seniors (those above the age of 65, the qualified disabled, and those with end stage renal desease) Traditional Medicare allows you to go to **ANY DOCTOR**, or **HOSPITAL in the Continental United States that takes Medicare** and **you can choose your own provider**.  When on Traditional Medicare, there are **No Doctor Co-Payments** for services and if you receive a diagnosis and want a second opinion, you can get one without asking the permission of any doctor and Medicare will pay for it as long as provider accepts Medicare and the service you are receiving is a Medicare approved service.\n\n**There are no copay's!**  You can go to any doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare and Medicare will pay thier portion of the approved bill.  When staying on Traditional Medicare we advise purchasing a **Medigap policy** which will cover most and in some cases all expenses not covered by Medicare.\n\n**Drug Coverage**\n\nWhen enrolling in Medicare it is advisable to be sure you include Drug Coverage when you first enroll.   When choosing Traditional Medicare, we advise you get a stand alone Part D prescription drug plan to go with your Medigap policy.\n\nWhen choosing a Medicare Advantage plan, many include drug coverage.  It is important that you include drug coverage with whatever plan you choose even if you don't currently take prescriptions, or you could have to pay a penalty if you add prescription coverage later, unless you have continuous credible drug coverage from another source.\n\nOne of our advisors can review all these details with you and can even tell you which plan will give you the most cost effective coverage based upon your current list of prescriptions."
