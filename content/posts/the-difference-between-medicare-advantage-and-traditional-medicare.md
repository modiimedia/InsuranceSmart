**My experience has shown that staying on Original Medicare and not Medicare Advantage is almost always the better choice for our clients**.

When a client is on Original Medicare and has a good Medicare Supplement policy, clients can go to any doctor or hospital that takes Medicare and the providers bill Medicare and the Medicare Supplement Insurance company for any Medicare approved services without need for preauthorization. This includes doctor visits, specialist visits, lab and diagnostic testing, radiology, imaging, in or out patient surgery, hospitalization etc. As a result, care is rendered more rapidly and without the provider having to measure cost because Medicare will pay the provider Medicare approved charges for any and all medically necessary services rendered.  This gives clients the assurance of no surprises from a cost and service standpoint and also provides the most freedom for clients to choose the providers they are comfortable with during treatment. It also allows clients to see specialists without referrals and get second opinions when they feel it is in their best interest and Medicare with their supplement will pay cover their respective costs for the care.

Medicare Advantage however, changes this dynamic dramatically. That is because Medicare Advantage plans receives compensation from Medicare when the client enrolls and not when services are rendered. As a result, all costs for a clients care are a direct expense to the Medicare Advantage so when services are rendered and therefore, costs for care are often scrutinized and not rendered as quickly as they would be on Original Medicare.  On Medicare Advantage, certain tests, procedures, and care have to go through a preauthorization process for approval and in some cases are denied and determine not necessary from the planâ€™s perspective.  In addition, most Medicare Advantage plans require you to use certain providers and referrals are typically required for specialists etc.

**In our experience Original Medicare with a good Medicare Supplement policy is a better option.**  While upfront cost (or monthly premium) may exceed the monthly upfront cost of many Medicare Advantage plans, we believe the overall benefits received make staying on Original Medicare a better choice when care is needed. These benefits include choosing any doctor, hospital, or provider in the USA that accepts Medicare and the ability to get second opinions and see specialists without asking permission. In addition, the modest premium greatly reduces the clients out of pocket costs during a major illness or procedure. As an example, a client on Original Medicare with one of the more popular Plan G Supplements has a maximum out of pocket expenses of only $226 per year in 2023. This compared to Maximum Out Of Pocket Expense on Medicare Advantage of between $2500 to over $10,000 per year in network, and this can go even higher out of network.
