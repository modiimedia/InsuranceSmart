## Discounts For Homeowners

Get premium quality insurance coverage without the premium quality price by applying available discounts.

**Get a Package Deal** and **save up to 15 percent** when you allow us to provide both your homeowners and [**auto**](/products/auto) policies.

**Burglar Alarm/Fire Sprinkler/ Homes Near Fire Stations**  
Discounts are available for a burglar alarm or fire sprinkler system installed in your home. You may also qualify for lower rates if you live close to a fire station.

**If Your Home is Less Than 10 Years Old** we also offer a newer home discount .

**Choosing a Higher Deductible** will lower your insurance premium because you are sharing more of the risk of a qualified loss payment to you. For example, a $500 deductible requires you to pay the first $500 of a loss out of your own pocket. Raising this deductible to $1000 or more will lower your insurance bill, but increase your out of pocket expense from $500 to $1000 if you file a claim.

**Pay Your Bill in Full** when you start or renew your policy, instead of paying on monthly installments also saves you money.

**Additional Multiple Policy Discounts** are available and save you even more if you secure additional policies with us and include coverage for your [**auto,**](/products/auto) [**motorcycle**](/products/motorcycle), [**boat**](/products/boat/), [**RV**](/products/rv/)**,** or an [**Umbrella**](/products/umbrella) policy.

Contact one our our [**local independent agents**](/contact 'Contact an agent.') with questions. We are here to help identify discounts you may qualify for, and guarantee professional service to get you the coverage you need, at a price you can afford.
