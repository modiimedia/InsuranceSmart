By Mike Sosso, Founder & Executive Director of Sosso Insurance Group and InsuranceSmart.

My experience has shown that staying on Traditional Medicare is almost always the better choice for our clients.

The reason is that when a client is on Traditional Medicare and has a good Medicare Supplement policy in place, the provider looks at the client as an asset and is able to bill Medicare and the Medicare Supplement policy for Medicare approved services without any preauthorization. This can include doctor visits, specialist visits, lab and diagnostic testing and radiology, in or out patient surgery, hospitalization etc. As a result, care is more rapidly rendered and without concern for cost by the provider because Medicare will pay Medicare approved charges for medically necessary services rendered.

On a Medicare Advantage plan however, the dynamic changes dramatically. This is because a Medicare Advantage plan receives compensation from Medicare when a client enrolls in the plan and not when services are rendered. As a result, when services are rendered, the services become a cost to the Medicare Advantage plan as it is the plan’s responsibility to cover these costs from total revenues received. Therefore, costs for care are sometimes scrutinized and are not always rendered as quickly and in some cases procedures and certain care can even be denied as provider may determine the requested services are not necessary from the plan’s perspective.

In our experience it is apparent that to stay on Traditional Medicare with a good Medicare Supplement policy while the upfront cost (or monthly premium) may exceed the monthly cost of many Medicare Advantage plans, the overall client benefits, assurance of care, and security of client selection and control, make staying on Traditional Medicare well worth the premium. In addition, paying this premium upfront makes a huge difference in terms of benefits available to the client as well as greatly limiting the exposure the client has to future out of pocket costs during a major illness or procedure. The max out of pocket expenses a client faces on Traditional Medicare with a Plan G Medicare Supplement in 2022 was only $233 per year vs the average out of pocket maximin on many Medicare Advantage plans of up to $7500 per year in network and even higher if out of network.
