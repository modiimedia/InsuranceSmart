          longer apply.

## **A Final Suggestion From Our Founder**

"I always recommend adding a additional supplemental coverage to cover out of pocket expenses that may occur in case of an Accident or Critical Illness with any Fixed Indemnity Plan for added protection. I recommend with UHC Health Protectorguard packaging this with Accident ProGuard and Critical Illness Insurance fills potential gaps and provides real peace of mind should you or a family member suffer a qualifying critical illness. The policy I recommend provides a lump sum cash benefit of $10,000 to $50,000 paid directly to the policyholder in event of a qualifiying critical illness. The cash is yours to use wherever you need it, whether to make up for lost income during a critical illness and pay household bills, or to pay medical expenses that are not covered by your medical insurance.  I typically recommend $30,000 to $50,000 of coverage be added to the indemnity plan and you often still pay less than Obamacare. Plus you get real peace of mind with the added cash benefits allowed if you suffered a critical illness that Obamacare does not provide. *[\*\*\_Critical Illness Insurance *\*\*](https://bknplar1v3nalq.preview.forestry.io/products/health/critical-illness/)_by UnitedHealthcare is an affordable addition that fits exceptionally well with Health ProtectorGuard."\_
