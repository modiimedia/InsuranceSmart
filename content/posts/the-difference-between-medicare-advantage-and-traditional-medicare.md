**My experience has shown that staying on Traditional Medicare is almost always the better choice for our clients**.

When a client is on Traditional Medicare and has a good Medicare Supplement policy, clients can go to any doctor or hospital that takes Medicare and the providers are able to bill Medicare and the Medicare Supplement Insurance company for any Medicare approved services without need for preauthorization. This includes doctor visits, specialist visits, lab and diagnostic testing, radiology, imaging, in or out patient surgery, hospitalization etc. As a result, care is rendered more rapidly and without having to measure cost by the provider because Medicare will pay Medicare approved charges for medically necessary services rendered.

Medicare Advantage however, the dynamic changes dramatically. This is because a Medicare Advantage plan receives compensation from Medicare when a client enrolls in the plan and not when services are rendered. As a result, when services are rendered, they are a direct expense to the Medicare Advantage plan and it is the plan’s responsibility to cover these costs from total revenues received. Therefore, costs for care are sometimes scrutinized and are not always rendered as quickly as they would be on Traditional Medicare, and in some cases procedures and certain services are even denied as the provider may determine them not necessary from the plan’s perspective.

**In our experience Traditional Medicare with a good Medicare Supplement policy is a better option.**  While upfront cost (or monthly premium) may exceed the monthly cost of many Medicare Advantage plans, the overall benefits received make staying on Traditional Medicare well worth the premium. These benefits include choosing any doctor, hospital, or provider in the USA that accepts Medicare and the ability to get second opinions and see specialists without asking permission of your provider. In addition, the modest premium paid upfront greatly reduces the exposure client has to future out of pocket costs during a major illness or procedure as the max out of pocket expenses a client faces on Traditional Medicare with a Plan G Supplement in 2022 was only $233 per year. This compared to the average out of pocket maximin between $2500 to $7500 per year on many Medicare Advantage plans in the plans network network and these can go even higher out of network.
