      answer:
          No, the UnitedHealthcare Critical Illness Insurance pays cash benefits directly
          to you when you suffer a qualifying critical illness. It does pay for regular    medical
          visits like hospital visits. You should maintain separate comprehensive health
          coverage for day to day medical expenses. We recommend pairing this product      with
          a fixed hospital indemnity plan like Health ProtectorGuard to cover regular medical
          expenses and hospital visits.

          initial 12 month period has passed the preexisting condition limitation will no
          longer apply.
