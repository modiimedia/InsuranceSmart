answer = "**Medicare Advantage** is a program designed to save money for the federal government.  When you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan (MA), you actually disenroll from Traditional Medicare as your primary insurance provider.  The MA plan you choose is responsible ro provide all your medical care.  Most MA plans have a network and will not pay for services outside of network, or they may charge a higher price outside of network.  Some plans have broader choices, but in most cases you must have a Primary Care Provider to navigate you through thier system to include which specialists and other services you are administered. \n\nIn addition, Medicare Advantage plans all various co-payments for doctor visits, specialists, hospital stays, ER, etc. and have maximum annual out of pocket cost members would be responsible for in event of significant services rendered in a year and it ranges from $2500 to $7500 in network depending upon the plan you choose.  Out of network the amounts increase and in some cases no services will be rendered out of network.   \n\n**Traditional Medicare** is the original program established by the Social Security Administration for the medical care of seniors (those above the age of 65, the qualified disabled, and those with end stage renal desease) Traditional Medicare allows you to go to **ANY DOCTOR**, or **HOSPITAL in the Continental United States that takes Medicare** and **you can choose your own provider**.  In addition, if you receive a diagnosis and want to get a second opinion, you can and Medicare will pay for it as long as the doctor you choose accepts Medicare and the service you are receiving is a Medicare approved service. \n\n**There are no copay's!**  You can go to any doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare and Medicare will pay thier portion of the approved bill.  When staying on Traditional Medicare we advise purchasing a **Medigap policy** which will cover most and in some cases all expenses not covered by Medicare.  \n\n**Drug Coverage**\n\nWhen enrolling in Medicare it is advisable to be sure you include Drug Coverage when you first enroll.   When choosing Traditional Medicare, we advise you get a stand alone Part D prescription drug plan to go with your Medigap policy.  \n\nWhen choosing a Medicare Advantage plan, many include drug coverage.  It is important that you include drug coverage with whatever plan you choose even if you don't currently take prescriptions, or you could have to pay a penalty if you add prescription coverage later, unless you have continuous credible drug coverage from another source. \n\nOne of our advisors can review all these details with you and can even tell you which plan will give you the most cost effective coverage based upon your current list of prescriptions.
