          underinsured to sufficiently cover the damages, bodily injury and loss incurred
          to you,  your passengers and your vehicle.  We always recommend you purchase this
          and at limits equal to the level of your own liability coverage. '

          this?

          Personal Injury Protection and Medical Payments is coverage that pays a
          stated limit for damages incurred to individuals riding within your vehicle in
          the event of an accident caused by you or someone driving your vehicle.  Personal

## Consider increasing your liability limits for a fraction of the cost.

Most state minimum liability requirements of somewhere around 25,000 / 50,000 don't adequately protect consumers from liability if you were involved in a serious accident. For this reason we always recommend considering at minimum 100,000 / 300,000 liability protection to provide more coverage incase the unexpected should occur. Most carriers will go up to 250,000 / 500,000 again for a small increase in premium and this extra protection could make the difference in a loss that would otherwise place you or your family in unwanted financial exposure. The overal benefit protetion from increasing your liability limits in our professional opinion and experience far outweighs the modest cost increase incurred by adding this benefit.
