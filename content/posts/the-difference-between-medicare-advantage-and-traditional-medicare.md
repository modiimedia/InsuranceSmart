**My experience has shown that staying on Traditional Medicare is almost always the better choice for our clients**.

When a client is on Traditional Medicare and has a good Medicare Supplement policy, clients can go to any doctor or hospital that takes Medicare and the providers are able to bill Medicare and the Medicare Supplement Insurance company for any Medicare approved services without need for preauthorization. This includes doctor visits, specialist visits, lab and diagnostic testing, radiology, imaging, in or out patient surgery, hospitalization etc. As a result, care is rendered more rapidly and without the provider having to measure cost because Medicare will pay the provider Medicare approved charges for medically necessary services rendered.  This also gives the client the assurance of no surprises from a cost and service standpoint and gives them the most freedom to choose providers they are comfortable with during treatment.

Medicare Advantage however, changes this dynamic dramatically because a Medicare Advantage plan receives compensation from Medicare when the client enrolls in the plan and not when services are rendered. As a result, when services are rendered, they are a direct expense to the Medicare Advantage plan because it is the plan’s responsibility to cover these costs from total revenues received. Therefore, costs for care are sometimes scrutinized and not always rendered as quickly as they would be on Traditional Medicare, and in some cases procedures and certain services are even denied as the provider may determine them not necessary from the plan’s perspective.  In addition, most Medicare Advantage plans require you to use their network providers and referrals are typically required for specialists etc.

**In our experience Traditional Medicare with a good Medicare Supplement policy is a better option.**  While upfront cost (or monthly premium) may exceed the monthly cost of many Medicare Advantage plans, we believe the overall benefits received make staying on Traditional Medicare well worth the premium. These benefits include choosing any doctor, hospital, or provider in the USA that accepts Medicare and the ability to get second opinions and see specialists without asking permission. In addition, the modest premium paid upfront greatly reduces the clients exposure to future out of pocket costs during a major illness or procedure. As an example, on one of the more popular supplement Plan G's the max out of pocket expenses for a client per year on Traditional Medicare in 2022 was only $233 per year. This compares to the average out of pocket maximin between $2500 to $7500 per year on many Medicare Advantage plans for service rendered in network and these typically go even higher out of network.
