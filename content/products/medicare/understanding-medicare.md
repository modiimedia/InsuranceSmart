mikes_take = "My experience has shown that staying on Traditional Medicare is almost always the better choice for our clients.\n\nThe reason is that when a client is on Traditional Medicare and has a good Medicare Supplement policy in place, the provider looks at the client as an asset and is able to bill Medicare and the Medicare Supplement policy for Medicare approved services without any preauthorization.  This can include doctor visits, specialist visits, lab and diagnostic testing and radiology, in or out patient surgery, hospitalization etc. As a result, care is more rapidly rendered and without concern for cost by the provider because Medicare will pay Medicare approved charges for medically necessary services rendered.\n\nOn a Medicare Advantage plan however the dynamic changes dramatically.  This is because a Medicare Advantage plan receives compensation from Medicare when a client enrolls in the plan and not when services are rendered.  As a result when services are rendered, the services become a cost to the Medicare Advantage plan as it is the plans responsibility to cover these costs from total revenues received.  As a result costs for care are sometimes scrutinized and can not be rendered as quickly and in some cases care or certain procedures can even be denied as the plan provider may determine the requested services are not necessary from the plans perspective.\n\nIn our experience it is apparent that while the up front cost (or monthly premium) to stay on Traditional Medicare with a good Medicare Supplement policy may exceed the monthly premium cost of many Medicare Advantage plans, the overall client benefits, assurance of care, and security of client selection and control, make staying on Traditional Medicare well worth the extra premium dollars.  In addition these few dollars greatly limit the exposure of the client to future out of pocket costs during a major illness or procedure  as max out of pocket expenses on Traditional Medicare with a plan G in 2022 was only $233 per year vs up to $7500 or more in network on a Medicare Advantage plan and even more for services out of network."

This is would apply unless you are currently enrolled in an employer group plan or some other credible coverage and plan to keep that coverage past your 65th birthday.\n\nA licensed agent is available to answer all your questions and advise you based upon your personal situation."

answer = "**Medicare Advantage** was designed to save Medicare money and cut their costs.  When you enroll in Medicare Advantage (MA), you disenroll from Medicare and the MA plan you choose becomes 100% responsible for all your medical care.  Most MA plans incorporate a provider network and either will not pay for services out of network or charge a higher price for services out of network.  Some have broader choices, but in most cases you have a Primary Care Provider to navigate you through all provider services to include specialists, hospitals, and other services.  Most care and procedures must be approved by the plan prior to services being rendered.\n\nIn addition, most Medicare Advantage plans require co-payments for doctor visits, specialists, hospital stays, ER, etc. and all have a maximum annual dollar amount you must pay each year for out of pocket expenses and in the event you utilize a lot of services in a year and this could range from $2500 to $7500 in network, and even more out of network depending upon the plan you choose.  In some cases no services will be covered Out of Network.\n\n**Traditional Medicare** is the original program established by the Social Security Administration for the medical care of seniors (those above the age of 65, the qualified disabled, and those with end stage renal disease). Traditional Medicare allows you to go to **ANY DOCTOR**, or **HOSPITAL in the Continental United States that takes Medicare** and **you can choose your own provider**.  When on Traditional Medicare, there are **No Doctor Co-Payments** for services and if you receive a diagnosis and want a second opinion, you can get one without asking for permission and Medicare will pay the care as long as the provider accepts Medicare, and the service rendered is a Medicare approved service.\n\nWhen choosing Traditional Medicare **there are no copay's!**  You can go to any doctor or hospital that accepts Medicare.  When on Traditional Medicare we always advise purchasing a **Medigap policy** in order to cover costs not covered by Medicare. When this is done your max out of pocket exposure can be as low as $233 to $0 per year when you choose from the most popular plans which are Plan G or Plan F. We typically recommend plan G as we have have found in most situations to be the most cost effective solution for our clients."
question = "What is the difference between Medicare Advantage and Traditional Medicare?"

answer = "**Drug Coverage.** When enrolling in Medicare we typically will advise you to include Drug Coverage when you first enroll even if you are not taking any prescriptions. The reason is if you do not have credible drug coverage in place when you first enroll and later decide to add a drug plan, you could be penalized and have to pay a higher premiums for drug coverage unless you had other continuous credible drug coverage from another source.  \n\nIf you have decided to stay with Traditional Medicare, we advise a stand alone Part D prescription drug plan be added to go along with a Medigap policy. One of our licensed professionals can show you how to find the most cost effective drug plan for you from the large selection of plans (typically 25-30 plans available in each area) based upon the exact list of prescriptions you are currently taking.\n\nIf you have decided a Medicare Advantage plan is right for you, be sure to include one with drug coverage unless you have other credible drug coverage through another source.  Again it is advisable that you include your list of prescriptions in your evaluation of the MA plan because costs of drugs can vary greatly depending upon the list of prescriptions and plan you choose. \n\nOne of our advisors can review all these details with you and show you which plan gives you the most cost effective coverage based upon your specific need and your current list of prescriptions.\n\nKeep in mind that in most cases, you have to keep your drug plan in place for the entire calendar year unless you qualify for a special enrollment period. The annual enrollment period to shop or change your prescription drug Part D Coverage is October 15 through December 7th each year and the effective date for new coverage if you change plans is the first of January the following year.
