Most seniors do not realize Medicare Advantage (or Plan C) is an alternative to Original
Medicare and transfers responsibility for your care to private insurance. Advantage
plans receive payment when you enroll whether you see them for services or not. To
control costs, all plans require preauthorization for services like expensive diagnostics,
treatment, or surgery, and can sometimes delay or deny coverage. You can appeal but
this takes time and does not guarantee approval. In addition, annual maximum out of
pocket exposure on Advantage plans range from $2500 to $12,000 and often limit
service to certain providers.

When on Original Medicare, providers bill Medicare directly for services with little to no
preauthorization required and allow you to see any provider in the USA accepting
Medicare. We recommend adding supplemental coverage (Medigap or Medicare
Supplement policy) to provide the best protection. This requires a premium but Medigap
Plan G for example reduces maximum out of pocket cost to $240 for all approved
services in 2024.

Medicare Advantage plans typically have little or no premiums but when serious medical
issues arise, Original Medicare with Medigap typically offer greater provider choices,
quicker diagnostics, and significantly lower overall out of pocket costs, which could be
better. Also, if on an Advantage plan you want to switch back to Original Medicare, you
may not be able to secure a Medigap policy if you have health issues that do not pass
underwriting. For this reason, I usually recommend Original Medicare with Medigap
when you first enroll or as soon as you qualify for Medigap.

Medigap premiums for a 65-year-old average between $95 - $200. Premiums can
increase over time, but because we are Independent and represent several major
carriers, we shop through the years to get clients the best possible rate for the plan type
they desire.
