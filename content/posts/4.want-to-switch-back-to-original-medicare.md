If you’re currently enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan but have been reconsidering your options, we have good news: from __January 1 through March 31, 2025__, you have the chance to switch back to __Original Medicare__. The annual Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period is a perfect time to reassess your healthcare needs and make a change if your Advantage plan isn’t working for you. 

__Let’s explore why Original Medicare might be the better fit and how it can benefit you.__

## Why Switch to Original Medicare?

__Original Medicare__ (Parts A and B) offers flexibility and freedom that many find appealing, especially when paired with a Medicare Supplement (Medigap) plan. Here are some of the standout benefits:

### 1. See Your Doctor – or Any Doctor!

With Original Medicare, you’re not locked into a network. If your current doctor accepts Medicare (and most do), you can keep seeing them without issue. In fact, on Original Medicare you can visit any provider nationwide that accepts Medicare—no referrals needed. This is a huge advantage over Medicare Advantage plans, which often restrict you to a specific network of providers. This is especially relevant if you sometimes spend time in different parts of the country visiting children and grandchildren.

### 2. Limited Out-of-Pocket Costs with a Supplement

One of the biggest perks of Original Medicare paired with a Medigap plan is the cap on your out-of-pocket expenses. Without a supplement, Original Medicare covers 80% of Part B costs after your deductible, leaving you with potentially unlimited 20% coinsurance. But with a Medigap plan (like Plan G, one of the most popular options), your total annual out-of-pocket costs are dramatically reduced. 

For example, with Medigap Plan G in 2025, you’d only pay the __Part B deductible ($257 annually)__ out of pocket. After that, the plan covers the entire remaining 20% of Part B costs and other expenses, leaving you with no additional cost-sharing for covered services. Compare that to Medicare Advantage, where out-of-pocket maximums can reach __$8,850 or more per year__ depending on the plan.

### 3. No Preauthorization Hassles

Tired of waiting for your Medicare Advantage plan to approve tests, procedures, or specialist visits? With Original Medicare, there are __no preauthorization requirements__. You and your doctor decide what care you need, when you need it—without jumping through insurance hoops. This streamlined access can be a game-changer, especially for those with chronic conditions or urgent medical needs.

## Making the Switch

If you’re in Medicare Advantage and want to return to Original Medicare, act now—your window closes on __March 31, 2025__. You can call 1-800-MEDICARE directly, but it is advisable to work with a licensed insurance agent to make sure you first qualify for a Medigap policy. This will limit your out-of-pocket costs you would otherwise be responsible for on Original Medicare. Once that is determined a qualified professional can also then help you disenroll from your Advantage plan to get you back in Original Medicare. You will want the added protection of a Medigap plan, this is done separately, and it’s wise to do so during this period to ensure seamless coverage.  Call us or fill out the form below and we will get right back to you.

## The Bottom Line

Switching to Original Medicare gives you unparalleled flexibility, access to a broader range of providers, and peace of mind with predictable costs when paired with a supplement. No networks, no preapprovals, and no surprises—just straightforward healthcare that puts you in control. Don’t miss your chance to make the change by March 31—your health deserves it!
